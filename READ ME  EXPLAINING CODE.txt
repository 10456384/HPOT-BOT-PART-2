

So this is just a quick explanation of how my HPOT BOT works, i tried to keep the structure neat but also simple so that it runs properly as a C# console app.

The project starts in the Main method like usual, where i first clear the screen and then display an ascii logo for the bot. I called it HPOT BOT which stands for "Helpful Protecter of technology Bot", which I thought sounds cool and explains what it does.

Then the user is asked to enter they’re name (sorry if grammar bad), and the bot greets them personally using their name, which I store in a variable called `userName`. I wanted it to feel more like a conversation, not just a boring terminal app.

After that, I explain what the bot can do. The menu shows 5 different topics related to cybersecurity:
1. Phishing Awareness
2. Password Safety
3. Safe Browsing
4. Social Media Safety
5. Cyber Hygiene Tips

Once the user picks a topic either by number or typing the name, the bot will show a defenition of the topic first and then give some safety tips. For example, it says something like "John, phishing is when someone tries to trick you into sharing personal info..."

I made sure that the answers and intro always stay visible by never using Console.Clear after the start. I learned that users can get confused when the screen refreshes too much and you lose context.

I also added a list called `chatHistory` which keeps track of everything the user and bot said. It makes it more like a scrollable conversation. Every time a question is answered, it logs the user choice and the bot response into that list.

The menu and welcome text are printed every time the user makes a new choice so they don’t forget what to choose next.

There’s a few helper methods like:
- `DisplayOpeningLogo()` – shows the ASCII title
- `DisplayChatbotMenu()` – shows the main options
- `DisplayChatHistory()` – shows everything that’s been said so far
- Plus methods like `ProvidePhishingInfo()` which prints the actual info

I also made the bot exit cleanly if the user types “0” any time during the menu input.

I know it could maybe be cleaner with classes or objects but for now I just tried to keep it simple and easy to read.
